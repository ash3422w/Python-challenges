# Student Performance Analyzer

## Introduction

This project is part of the Python: Code2Xplore -- 60 Days Challenge.\
The objective of this program is to analyze student performance using
internal assessment marks.

## Description

The program takes N student marks as input and stores them in a list.\
Each mark is processed using a for loop and classified into categories
such as: - Excellent - Very Good - Good - Average - Fail - Invalid

It also counts the total number of valid students and failed students
and displays a final summary.

## Personalization

This solution includes a personalized rule based on my register number
(AP24110011640).\
Since the last digit is even, 2 marks are deducted from each student
before classification.\
This changes the program logic and ensures uniqueness.

## Classification Criteria

-   90 -- 100 : Excellent
-   75 -- 89 : Very Good
-   60 -- 74 : Good
-   40 -- 59 : Average
-   0 -- 39 : Fail
-   \< 0 or \> 100 : Invalid

## Constraints Followed

-   Used for loop
-   Used list
-   Used if-elif-else conditions
-   No max(), min(), sum()
-   No dictionary or set

## Learning Outcome

Through this project, I improved my understanding of lists, loops, and
conditional statements in Python.\
I also learned how to apply personalized logic to modify program
behavior.
